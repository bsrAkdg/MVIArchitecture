MVI Architecture Notes

- MVI is a Event driven architecture. In this example, on the menu when you clicked get user item,
you fire a get user event in ViewModel. ViewModel handles it and send call according method in
repository layer.

- Every ViewModel has unique all of them :
    - MainViewState : unique data
    - MainStateEvent : unique event
    - unique ViewModel
    - unique Repository

-  Fragment observe LiveData on ViewModel
    -> action (set new action event from Fragment to ViewModel)
        -> ViewModel handle it (observe event changes)
            -> ViewModel receives data from Repository and notify Fragment
                -> Fragment handle and update data ViewModel (observe updated data on Fragment)
                    -> Fragment update UI from updated data (If you want you can send data to Activity with listeners)
